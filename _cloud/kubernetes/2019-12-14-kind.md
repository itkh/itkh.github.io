Previous article, we have talked about [minikube](/cloud/kubernetes/2019-12-13-minikube). Today let's talk about another tool called _kind_, used to run Kubernetes locally.

## What is kind?
Kind is a tool for running local Kubernetes clusters using Docker container “nodes”. The word 'Kind' comes from 'Kubernestes-in-Docker', which indicates that we create Kubernetes cluster inside Docker container. Since it uses Docker container as a node(s) to deploy Kubernetes on, Kubernetes cluster can be deployed shortly in less than a minute. This can help developers to reduce deploying time when testing Kubernetes.

Kind consists of:
- Go packages implementing cluster creation, image build, etc.
- A command line interface (kind) built on these packages.
- Docker image(s) written to run systemd, Kubernetes, etc.
- kubetest integration also built on these packages (WIP)

## Installation
### Installing Kind from source code
Kind has been implemented in [Golang](https://golang.org/){:target="\_blank"}, so in order to build Kind from source code you need to have Go installed on your system. It is recommended to use the latest version of Golang, ideally go v1.14 or greater.   
You can install Kind with `go get` command:
```shell
GO111MODULE="on" go get sigs.k8s.io/kind@v0.8.1
```

Or you can clone its repository and run `make build`:
```shell
git clone https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/kind.git
cd kind
make build
```

### Installing Kind with binary file
Kind also provides stable binaries which are available on the [releases](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/kind/releases){:target="\_blank"} page. You can download binary directly and put into your environment $PATH location.
```shell
curl -Lo ./kind https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/dl/v0.8.1/kind-$(uname)-amd64
chmod +x ./kind
mv ./kind /usr/local/bin/kind
```

## Creating a Kubernetes Cluster
Once you install Kind on your system, you can create a Kubernetes cluster as simple as `kind create cluster`. Since Kind uses Docker container as a node to run Kubernetes, make sure that you have Docker installed on your system before you execute kind command to deploy cluster.   

> Docker is an open platform for developing, shipping, and running applications. It uses OS-level virtualization to deliver software in packages called containers, which separate your application from your infrastructure.  
Read [Docker official](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/) page how to install Docker on specific distribution using Docker Repository

- Install Docker on Ubuntu Using Default Repository
  - Uninstall old version if exists:
  ```shell
  sudo apt-get remove docker docker-engine docker.io
  ```
  - Install Docker
  ```shell
  sudo apt-get update
  sudo apt install docker.io
  ```
  - Start and Enable automatically run at startup
  ```shell
  sudo systemctl start docker
  sudo systemctl enable docker
  ```
  - Verify the installed Docker
  ```shell
  docker --version  
  ```

- Creating a Cluster with Kind command `kind create cluster`
  ```shell
  > kind create cluster
  Creating cluster "kind" ...
   ✓ Ensuring node image (kindest/node:v1.18.2) 🖼
   ✓ Preparing nodes 📦  
   ✓ Writing configuration 📜
   ✓ Starting control-plane 🕹️
   ✓ Installing CNI 🔌
   ✓ Installing StorageClass 💾
  Set kubectl context to "kind-kind"
  You can now use your cluster with:  

  kubectl cluster-info --context kind-kind

  Thanks for using kind! 😊  
  ```

  The default cluster context name is 'kind'. If you want to create a cluster with another name or create one more cluster, use option `--name`.
  ```shell
  kind create cluster --name my-new-cluster
  ```

  You can check your cluster with command `get`:
  ```shell
  kind get clusters
  ```

## Interacting with your Cluster
Just like previous post about minikube, you can interact with your cluster by using `kubectl` command. Make sure you have installed kubectl already before you can execute its command. see previous post about minikube and how to [install kubectl](/kubernetes/minikube/#install-kubectl).

- Get cluster info:
  ```shell
  sophal@u20-server:$ kubectl cluster-info
  Kubernetes master is running at https://127.0.0.1:46217
  KubeDNS is running at https://127.0.0.1:46217/api/v1/namespaces/kube-system/services/kube-dns:dns/proxy

  To further debug and diagnose cluster problems, use 'kubectl cluster-info dump'.
  ```
- Get Node and Pod info:
  ```shell
  sophal@u20-server:$ kubectl get node,pod --all-namespaces
  NAME                      STATUS   ROLES    AGE   VERSION
  node/kind-control-plane   Ready    master   70m   v1.18.2

  NAMESPACE            NAME                                             READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
  kube-system          pod/coredns-66bff467f8-4xmqs                     1/1     Running   0          70m
  kube-system          pod/coredns-66bff467f8-vgsqw                     1/1     Running   0          70m
  kube-system          pod/etcd-kind-control-plane                      1/1     Running   0          70m
  kube-system          pod/kindnet-755xq                                1/1     Running   0          70m

  kube-system          pod/kube-scheduler-kind-control-plane            1/1     Running   0          70m
  local-path-storage   pod/local-path-provisioner-bd4bb6b75-wzkj5       1/1     Running   0          70m
  ```

As what I have mentioned above, Kind is a tool used to create Kubernetes cluster inside Docker container. So you can also interact your cluster through Docker as well.
- Verify a Docker container (Kind node) is running:
  ```shell
  sophal@u20-server:$ docker ps
  CONTAINER ID        IMAGE                  COMMAND                  CREATED             STATUS              PORTS                       NAMES
  01a15db65906        kindest/node:v1.18.2   "/usr/local/bin/entr…"   About an hour ago   Up About an hour    127.0.0.1:46217->6443/tcp   kind-control-plane
  ```

- Execution command into Docker container:
  ```shell
  [Usage]: docker exec {NAME} {COMMAND}
  docker exec kind-control-plane cat /etc/os-release
  ```

- Get access into Kind node (Docker container) and control cluster:
  - Using interactive tty access to container with bash:
    ```shell
    docker exec -it kind-control-plane bash
    root@kind-control-plane:/#    
    ```
    You are now on kind node, then you can control your cluster through `kubectl` directly there.
  - Copy Kubernetes `amdin.conf` to $HOME/.kube/config
    ```shell
    cp /etc/kubernetes/admin.conf $HOME/.kube/config
    ```
  - Now you can manage your cluster with `kubectl` directly on Kind node
    ```shell
    kubectl get node,pod -A
    ```

## Loading Image into Cluster
Docker images or image-archive (tar) can be loaded from your host computer into you cluster node with `kind load` command. To do so, make sure you have already pulled your Docker image into your host computer.
  - Get Docker image from public default Docker registry into your host computer: (ex: hello-world)
    ```shell
    docker pull hello-world
    ```
  - Verify hello-world image:
    ```shell
    docker images
    REPOSITORY           TAG          IMAGE ID            CREATED             SIZE
    kindest/node         <none>       de6eb7df13da        2 months ago        1.25GB
    hello-world          latest       bf756fb1ae65        6 months ago        13.3kB
    ```
   _kindest/node_, 'node' is an image name pulled from 'kindest' registry when we execute `kind create cluster` command to create a Kubernetes cluster.  
   _hello-world_ is a Docker image which we have pulled from Docker registry (By default, Docker registry name is not shown) with `docker pull hello-world`.

  - Load docker image:
    ```shell
    kind load docker-image hello-world:latest
    ```

  - Verify your load image
    - Access into kind node container:
      ```shell
      docker exec -it kind-control-plane bash
      ```
    - On Kind node, container runtime used to manage container is CRI (Container Runtime Interface) not Docker, so we can use `crictl images` to get container images info:
      ```shell
      root@kind-control-plane:/# crictl images
      IMAGE                                      TAG                 IMAGE ID            SIZE
      docker.io/kindest/kindnetd                 0.5.4               2186a1a396deb       113MB
      docker.io/library/hello-world              latest              bf756fb1ae65a       17.3kB
      docker.io/rancher/local-path-provisioner   v0.0.12             db10073a6f829       42MB
      k8s.gcr.io/coredns                         1.6.7               67da37a9a360e       43.9MB
      k8s.gcr.io/debian-base                     v2.0.0              9bd6154724425       53.9MB
      k8s.gcr.io/etcd                            3.4.3-0             303ce5db0e90d       290MB
      k8s.gcr.io/kube-apiserver                  v1.18.2             7df05884b1e25       147MB
      k8s.gcr.io/kube-controller-manager         v1.18.2             31fd71c85722f       133MB
      k8s.gcr.io/kube-proxy                      v1.18.2             312d3d1cb6c72       133MB
      k8s.gcr.io/kube-scheduler                  v1.18.2             121edc8356c58       113MB
      k8s.gcr.io/pause                           3.2                 80d28bedfe5de       686kB
      ```
      **docker.io/library/hello-world** is Docker image that we have just pushed from host computer.
    - [Optional] You can execute two commands above to verify load image with one line without `bash` through interactive tty:
      ```shell
      docker exec kind-control-plane crictl images
      ```

  - Load Docker image-archive (tar file):
    ```shell
    kind load image-archive /path/to/your-image-archive.tar
    ```

## Deleting a Cluster

If you have created a cluster with default name `kind create cluster`, then deleting is equally simple:
```shell
kind delete cluster
```

If you want to delete a specific cluster name, then use `--name` option:
```shell
kind delete cluster --name my-cluster-name
```
