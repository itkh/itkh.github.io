oVirt is a an open-source distributed virtualization solution, designed to manage your entire enterprise infrastructure. oVirt uses the trusted KVM hypervisor and is built upon several other community projects, including libvirt, Gluster, PatternFly, and Ansible.  
oVirt provides:
  - Rich web-based user interfaces for both admin and non-admin clusters
  - Integrated management of hosts, storage, and network configuration
  - Live migration of virtual machines and disks between hosts and storage
  - High availability of virtual machines in the event of host failure

oVirt is intended for production use and is available for following platforms:
  * Engine:
    - Red Hat Enterprise Linux
    - CentOS linux
  * Hosts:
    - Red Hat Enterprise Linux
    - CentOS Linux
    - oVirt Node (based on CentOS Linux)

oVirt is installed using graphical installer in Cockpit.
oVirt Engine and a Host are installed together with the Engine running as a Virtual machine on that Host. The more host you have in the cluster, the Engine Virtual machine will be highly available.

Once oVirt Engine is installed and you have added Hosts and configured storage, you can now install Virtual Machines as many as you want if your have enough hardware resources.

I have crated some videos of how to install oVirt both self-hosted engine and standalone manager, also the videos of how to install virtual machines.
