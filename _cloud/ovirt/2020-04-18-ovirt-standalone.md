# Standalone Engine Architecture
To install Standalone engine you must install an Enterprise Linux machine (RHEL or CentOS), then run the configuration script (engine-setup) and provide information about how you want to configure the oVirt Engine. Add hosts and storage after the Engine is running. At least two hosts are required for virtual machine high availability.
